# man command
*The `man command` provides a user manual of any commands or utilities you can run in Terminal, including the name, description, and options.*

## It consists of nine sections:

Executable programs or shell commands
System calls

Miscellaneous
To display the complete manual, enter:

``` 
man [command_name]
```

For example, you want to access the manual for the ls command:
```
man ls
```
Enter this command if you want to specify the displayed section:

```man [option] 
```[section_number] [command_name]

```
For instance, you want to see section 2 of the ls command manual:

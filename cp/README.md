# Copying files

## First example
1. cp can be used to copy the content from one **`file`** into another.

### Syntax
```
cp [filename1] [filename2]
```
- In this example, `filename1` and `filename2` should be  files that already exist.

## Second example
2. cp can also be used to copy the content from one file into a **`NEW file`**
### Syntax
```
cp [filename1] [filename2]
```
- In this example, `filename1` should be a file that already exists.

- In this example, `filename2` should be a file that does **`NOT`** exist.
    - AKA [destination argument]
